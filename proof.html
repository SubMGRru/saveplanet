Earth is one of the most beautiful places in our universe, an amazing combination of beauty and thoughtfulness. The place where we live. Our house. Yes?

[[House!-&gt;YesHome]]
[[I'm from another planet-&gt;AlienHome]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="YesHome" tags="" position="593,403" size="100,100">''Home!''
Definitely! Each person has an individual homeland and a small homeland. We are all united by the fact that we are from Earth. Despite this, our planet is not the only one, the Earth is surrounded by many other equally interesting and mysterious planets.

Most of the Earth is occupied by water. The ocean is only 2% explored and people still do not know all its secrets, but despite this, sea life inspires many people. Surely you wouldn't mind going to the sea shore?

[[Yep!-&gt;YesWater]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="AlienHome" tags="" position="743,403" size="100,100">''Really?''
Wow! This is funny. In any case, we hope that you enjoy coming to Earth. 

Most of the Earth is occupied by water. The ocean is only 2% explored and people still do not know all its secrets, but despite this, sea life inspires many people. Surely you wouldn't mind going to the sea shore?

[[Yep!-&gt;YesWater]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="YesWater" tags="" position="593,553" size="100,100">Hurry to disappoint you! Recently, one of the main environmental problems is the pollution of the world's oceans. 

//More than 70% of our planet's surface is covered with water. The volume of water in the World Ocean is enormous - 1370 million cubic kilometers.//

For several years now, the scientific environmental community has been looking for technologies to solve such a problem as plastic waste pollution of the World Ocean. At the moment, five huge garbage islands have been discovered which drift in the waters of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans and create huge risks for all their inhabitants. Some animals and fish take plastic micro-particles for phytoplankton and mistakenly eat them. The chicks of sea birds are attracted by larger plastic pieces of bright colors, young birds swallow them, condemning themselves to excruciating death.

&lt;img src="img/zhiteli-morskie.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"&gt;

This happens not only because of garbage. Power plants, for example, do the same harm. After all, waste water after leaving the power plants is quite warm, and some water residents die because of lack of adaptation to certain temperatures.

Crude oil and petroleum products are the main source of the world ocean pollution. Oil gets into the water as a result of man-made disasters, tanker crashes and well drilling, but a lot of oil products are discharged by ordinary sea transport. Oil spills lead to the death of a huge number of marine animals, fish and birds, and in addition, they prevent normal heat exchange between layers of water.

[[What can I do to help?-&gt;HelpSaveWater]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="HelpSaveWater" tags="" position="593,703" size="100,100">//First of all, love nature and treat it with respect!

As strange as it may be, problems with the ocean appeared due to human activity. It's just that you have to be careful with what we have.//

The work to prevent ocean pollution is huge and complex. It has to be systematic, not only from bottom to top, but also from top to bottom - through legislative initiatives. The WWF Marine Programme was developed for this very purpose. The Fund supports the creation of national marine parks and develops criteria for the designation of specially protected natural areas, develops sustainable fisheries, and conducts research to prove the harm to human activities. This work is carried out not out out out of pure love for science, but for an argumentative dialogue with politicians who have the power to permit or prohibit. WWF actively cooperates with the legislative authorities, but also takes practical steps: many remember the fund's action to save the birds affected by the oil spill.

[[Tell me more about WWF Foundation-&gt;WaterWWF]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="WaterOkay" tags="" position="518,853" size="100,100">''Global warming''

We all come from different parts of the world, our climate is different. In some parts of the world it's constantly cold, somewhere it rains constantly, and somewhere so hot that water is more expensive than gold.

//It does not matter.// You must be facing global warming. Take a look at the chart below, provided by NASA

&lt;img src="img/GlobalTemp.png" width="100%" height="100%"&gt;

You thought rightly. Over the years, since 1880, the climate has changed a lot. 

//Who knows,// maybe in the future the water will be in short supply because of the //high temperature//? 

Do you like the forest? Clean air, nature, seclusion.

[[I love forests, and nature.-&gt;iLoveForests]]
[[The woods? Who needs them!-&gt;idontLoveForests]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="WaterWWF" tags="" position="668,853" size="100,100">''WWF Foundation''

World Wildlife Fund is the largest international environmental organization. You can learn more about WWF programs and take part in them on the Fund's website.

[[Okay, next-&gt;WaterOkay]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="iLoveForests" tags="" position="443,1003" size="100,100">Perfect! Or not? In any case - another bad news! The bad news lurks here too, because people are rapidly destroying forests. For what? For the paper!

&lt;img src="img/scale_1200.webp" width="100%" height="100%"&gt;

Another problem whose consequences will soon be felt by all humanity is the destruction of forests. Tropical forests are not for nothing called the lungs of the planet. They process carbon dioxide, whose concentration in the atmosphere is constantly growing, into oxygen, necessary for breathing living organisms. In addition, deforestation and burning of forest plantations lead to risks such as desertification of soil and loss of biodiversity on Earth. It is extremely difficult to stop these processes as they require a comprehensive approach that involves a mass of economic, social and political tasks.

Maybe you should take a break and admire the foxes?

[[I still don't like forests, and nature-&gt;idontLoveForests2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="ForestsEnd" tags="" position="443,1153" size="100,100">As you can see, there are quite a few risks our world has faced. However, there is one reason for them. This is the consumer attitude of man to the planet, its resources, other living creatures of its inhabitants and, moreover, to each other.

None of the above problems can be solved in isolation. They can only be solved in a complex way if the vector of our consciousness changes towards the perception of the Earth as our common home, as a single living organism, whose cells we all are.

''Love the environment and everything that surrounds you! 
Love the Earth.''
